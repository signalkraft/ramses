1 What is RAMSES
--------------
RAMSES is an abbreviation for "Rendering Architecture for Multi-Screen
EnvironmentS". It implements a distributed system for rendering 3D content
with focus on bandwidth and resource efficiency.

For more details, see the Wiki pages.

2 Obtaining the source code
--------------

RAMSES can be cloned from its Genivi repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/GENIVI/ramses <ramses-sdk>
cd <ramses-sdk>
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

If you use the https variant, you will not get the required depenencies
and have to download them yourself! Therefore we strongly advice to use the
'git' protocol for download as shown above.

3 Building and testing
-----------------------------------
General building tips: RAMSES's build system is based on CMake. It has
mandatory components and optional components which are built only if
required dependencies and/or CMake flags are present. The CMake log will
provide info what was built and what not - a 'plus' indicating that something
was built, and 'minus' that it wasn't. If an optional component was not built,
CMake will list the missing dependencies which were not found or not built.
Check the CMake logs! Typical build errors:
- not able to find a compiler -> Check that you have a valid compiler!
- not able to find something in external/ folder -> Check that you downloaded the submodules as shown in section 2.)
- CMake can't identify the compiler of Visual studio Community edition -> You need to download a Windows SDK 8.1
- No renderer was built on linux -> Check that you have installed some of the platform packages (x11-dev, egl, openGL, wayland)

Building RAMSES on Windows:
- start CMake GUI
- select <ramses-sdk> as source path, choose arbitrary <build> folder.
Configure
If you want to build the tests, set 'ramses-sdk_BUILD_TESTS' to true in the CMake cache.
generate -> open solution in Visual Studio.

Building RAMSES on Linux with docker:

We prefer to build RAMSES in Docker because it abstracts the dependency installation
and the CMake invocations away from the user. Docker is installed slightly differently
on different distros, check the docker manual for your distro. The instructions below
are for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS:

```
apt install docker.io
groupadd docker             #can fail if already exists
usermod â€“aG docker $USER
newgrp docker               #logs your user into the new group, alternatively re-login or restart

docker run hello-world      #check that docker works

# build RAMSES docker container
cd <ramses-sdk>/scripts/docker
./build-basic-container.sh
# Start RAMSES docker
./start-basic-for-x11.sh    # (on wayland-enabled systems, optionally: ./start-basic-for-wayland.sh)
# Inside docker container
./build-ramses.sh
# optionally - check if all RAMSES features work on your system
./run-unittests.sh
```

Building RAMSES on Linux (without docker):

-Install dependencies using Distro of choice package manager. For example, for Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libgles2-mesa-dev
mkdir <build>
cd <build>
cmake <ramses-sdk>
```

You can also check the docker container setup scripts for a reference how to build:
```
<ramses-sdk>/scripts/docker/ramses-basic/Dockerfile         -> contains info about build dependencies
<ramses-sdk>/scripts/docker/runtime-files/build-ramses.sh   -> contains CMake command for building
```
